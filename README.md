# a-star_rubiks-cube

An attempt at solving Rubik's cube by classical graph search algorithms, i.e. DFS, BFS, and A*. The problem is complex as the number of Rubik's states possible by applying a sequence of operators is 43,252,003 274,489,856,000 (S. VAUGHEN, “Counting the Permutations of the Rubik's Cube”, Miami Dade College). Hence a custom approach to the problem.
